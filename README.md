# Binary Search in C++

![Binary Search Banner](https://your-image-link.com/banner.png) <!-- Optional: You can replace with a relevant image link or remove -->

## 📜 Overview
This project demonstrates an implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in C++. Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm with a time complexity of `O(log n)` for finding the position of a target element in a sorted array.

### Why Use Binary Search?
Binary Search reduces the time required to find an element in a sorted array by half in each iteration, making it much faster than linear search for large datasets.

## 💻 How Binary Search Works
1. **Divide**: Begin with the middle element of the sorted array.
2. **Compare**: If the middle element matches the target, return its index.
3. **Eliminate**: If the target is less than the middle element, search in the left half; otherwise, search in the right half.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the target element is found or the search space is exhausted.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax and data structures.
- A C++ compiler, such as `g++`, to run the code.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/binarySearch.git](https://github.com/ShubhamKrishna0/binarySearch.git)
   cd binarySearch
   ```
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ binary_search.cpp -o binary_search
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./binary_search
   ```

## 🔍 Binary Search Code Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int binarySearch(const std::vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.size() - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1; // Target not found
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};
    int target = 7;

    int result = binarySearch(arr, target);

    if (result != -1) {
        std::cout << "Element found at index: " << result << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Element not found." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` – Each iteration halves the search space.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` – Binary Search uses a constant amount of space.

## ⚡️ Example Usage

For an array `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]` and a target of `7`, the program will output:
```
Element found at index: 3
```

If the target is `4`, the program will output:
```
Element not found.
```
